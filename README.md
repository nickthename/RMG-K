# RMG-K (Rosalie's Mupen GUI - Kaillera)

Rosalie's Mupen GUI is a free and open-source mupen64plus front-end written in C++.
This fork is focused around netplay with the Kaillera protocol.

#### Frame Delay (Previously Ping Spoofing)
- This allows the users to set their own frame delay
- Auto, Server will assign frame delay based on ping.
- 1 - 9 frames = sets your frame delay by spoofing your ping toward the middle of the frame window (every 16ms)
- Notifies lobby and game room of frame delay spoofing

#### Drop Actually Works!
- Clicking Drop will stop emulation (if player 1 does it first, it will stop emulation for everyone. Everyone must still click drop
- After all players drop, the room owner is able to restart emulation for everyone

#### General Features
- Timestamps
- Direct Messaging (with colors)
#### Static Netplay Settings
FOR NOW, the following settings are hard coded when a user starts a netplay session:

| Setting | Local Play | Kaillera Netplay |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| RandomizeInterrupt | true (random) | false (deterministic) |
| CPU_Emulator | User's choice (default 2) | 2 (dynarec) |
| CountPerOp | ROM database / overlay | 0 (use ROM database) |
| CountPerOpDenomPot | 0 | 0 |
| SiDmaDuration | -1 | -1 |
| DisableExtraMem | User's choice | false (8MB enabled) |
| DisableSaveFileLoading | false (loads saves) | true (fresh saves) |
| RSP_Plugin | User's choice | Hacktarux/Azimer HLE RSP Plugin |

## Input

### Raphnet N64 Adapter support
- Yes, your N64 controller works :D
### GCC Adapter Support
- OEM Nintendo Gamecube adapter and Input Integrity Lossless adapter tested and working

### RMG-Input (pronounced Nrage)
RMG-Input was changed so it now uses independent per-axis scaling similar to the Ownasaurus [USBtoN64v2](https://github.com/Ownasaurus/USBtoN64v2) adapter and N-Rage input plugin:
- Should support most xinput devices
- Configurable range slider (0-100%) with default 66% to match N-Rage
- Linear scale: 100% = 127 (protocol max)
- Per-axis deadzone handling instead of circular deadzone
